# Lockers Control & Desktop Launcher

Welcome to the **Lockers Control** project. This repository contains two complementary applications that work together to manage a network of physical lockers:

- A Django-based web service that records locker activity, manages QR-code based access tokens, and provides an operator-friendly dashboard for opening lockers remotely.
- A lightweight cross-platform desktop utility that boots the Django backend and a bundled browser to deliver a kiosk-style experience for end users.

This document serves as the primary help page for contributors and operators. It explains how the system is structured, how it works under the hood, and how to install, configure, and run it.

## Project Overview

The system revolves around an embedded controller connected to locker hardware. Operators interact with lockers through QR codes that are generated by the web application. When a QR code is scanned, the web tier talks to the controller via serial commands to unlock the requested locker and records the transaction for auditing.

Key components:

- **`lockers.py`** – Coordinates the desktop GUI launcher, ensures Python dependencies are present, and starts the Django server in a subprocess when running in kiosk mode.
- **`web/` app** – Holds the Django models, views, forms, and URLs that power the QR code flow and the administrative pages.
- **`web/locker.py`** – Encapsulates serial communication helpers, QR-code cleanup, and command orchestration for the locker hardware.
- **`tests/`** – Regression tests that cover the desktop launcher behaviour and the locker utilities without requiring real hardware.

## How the Locker Workflow Operates

1. **Locker Definition** – Operators create locker records through the Django admin or web UI. Each locker is represented by a `Cell` model instance and is assigned a numeric identifier that maps to the physical hardware.
2. **QR Code Generation** – When a locker needs to be opened, the system generates a QR image and stores it in the configured `static/qr/` directory. The image contains encoded locker information.
3. **Scanning & Validation** – The user scans the QR code; the web application validates the locker ID using `LockerForm` and checks for existence in the database.
4. **Serial Command Dispatch** – The helper in `web/locker.py` opens the configured serial port, sends the unlock command to the hardware, waits for acknowledgement, and captures any connection issues.
5. **Post-Processing** – Upon success the QR image is deleted, the form resets, and a success banner is displayed. Errors bubble up as user-friendly messages without crashing the server.

The desktop launcher (`lockers.py`) simplifies deployment in kiosks by installing missing dependencies, launching Django with the correct settings module, and embedding a browser window that points to the local server.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or newer
- System packages required to build Python wheels (e.g. `build-essential`, `libssl-dev` on Debian-based systems)
- **Desktop launcher only:** GTK 3 and Cairo development headers (`sudo apt install gir1.2-webkit2-4.0 gir1.2-gtk-3.0 libcairo2-dev`
  on Debian/Ubuntu) so that PyGObject can compile.
- Access to the serial device that controls the lockers

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The command above installs everything required for the Django web service and shared utilities. When you need the kiosk-style
desktop launcher, install the extra dependencies as well:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-desktop.txt
```

Alternatively, when installing the package from a wheel or source distribution you can request the `desktop` extra:

```bash
pip install .[desktop]
```

If you are running the packaged desktop application, the launcher automatically checks for the required libraries and installs them into an isolated environment when missing.

### Database Setup

The default configuration uses SQLite. Apply migrations and create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Running the Applications

### Django Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:8000> to access the operator dashboard.

### Desktop Launcher

```bash
python lockers.py
```

The launcher boots the Django server in the background (if it is not already running) and opens the kiosk browser window. Use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the application.

### Production Notes

- Configure the serial port by setting the `LOCKER_SERIAL_PORT` environment variable or editing the settings file.
- Place custom static assets or templates in the `static/` and `templates/` directories. Run `python manage.py collectstatic` before deploying to production servers.
- To bundle the desktop app with PyInstaller, use the provided `lockers.spec` file: `pyinstaller lockers.spec`.

## Testing & Development

Run the automated test suite at any time:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

The tests include hardware-independent coverage of the serial communication helpers and the desktop launcher orchestration. When contributing changes, please add or update tests to describe the new behaviour and ensure `pytest` passes before opening a pull request.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes and add or update tests.
3. Run `python -m pytest` to verify the suite.
4. Submit a pull request describing your changes.

We welcome improvements to documentation, bug fixes, new features, and hardware integration enhancements.
